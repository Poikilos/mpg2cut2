
- BUGS
   Clip/selection stats not always showing on status line.

-  Rename/File-Open plugin issues.


- CHECK Traling packet alignment on Audio.
    AC3, MPA and LPCM frames are all diferent.

- make the "|" key act like the sequence ]+[
  to mark 2 separate clips in one key press.

- Save each clip to separate file.

- Auto-split at user selected MBs.
  Nearest SEQ, or nearest clip ?

- Time Offset based per file.

- Multiple Favourite Output Folders
  Should be easy.  
  Show list of Folder Names, using.existing Names Dialog.

-  PVA & TS formats - Audio Preview.

- BRIDGING TIME STAMPS ACROSS CLIP BOUNDARIES
   Probably need to rebuild like in ProjectX

- Balance Audio/Video frames.
  Analyse MPA, AC3, LPCM packets and Pic hdrs.

-. Adjust delay of output Audio to 472ms. (~1GOP)
   Will help with VOB compatibility.
   May reduce need for PVAstrumento.

- Lip Sync on preview.
  Need buffer pre-fetch and scan.

-. Manipulate Edit List.
   + Proper GUI.  

- General Purpose markers (with thumbnails)

- MPALIB crashes on bad data.
     AND doesn't decode mono correctly.
            Cannot get source to compile.
            MAYBE Use MAD decoder instead ?

- Allow ScrollBar navigation without stopping playback 

- Grab header from first VTS when opening N'th VTS.

- Snapshots
    . Smart Auto-Deinterlace decision ?
    . Vertical Centre Crop for 4:3  
    . Horizontal Middle-crop for Widescreen mask
    . JPEG output instead of BMP.

- General Abend trap.

- Separate the A52 decoder into separate DLL plugin.

- Some DTV mpg files contain VOB NAV packs.
  Allow this to be candidate for VOB Preservation

- Command line Interface
   Multiple Clips - based on TimeStamp.
   Multiple files

- VLC cannot play GMA files even straight from Twinhan.
  Figure out why, and invent a fix for it.

- Clip #0, Saved n clips not always correct.
  AND Sometimes CANCEL resets clip list to zero.

- CTRL-Drag'n'drop to reverse Open/Appen default ?
