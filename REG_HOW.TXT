

OLD MANUAL METHOD FOR ASSOCIATING MPG2CUT2 WITH MPEG FILES


This can be either done manually using Windows Explorer Options
or semi-manually using a REG file.

If you don't know anything about REG files,
use the following manual method in Windows 98 :-

	- Check what Windows Explorer calls mpeg files
	- Menu - View - Folder Options
	- File Types
	- Scroll down to the entry name relating to mpeg files
	- Click on the "Edit" button
	- Click into the retangle labelled "Actions"
	- Click on the "New" button
	- Create a new action called "EDIT"
	- "Browse" button to navigate to the folder
        where you have put the Mpg2Cut program
      - Highlight the file named "Mpg2Cut2.exe"
	- Click "OK"
	- Click "OK"
	- You may want to repeat the whole process for "VOB" files
	- Click "OK"


ALTERNATIVELY
=============

If you are quite familiar with REG files,
AND you have a current BACKUP of your System Registry,
try the following:- 

Edit the supplied file MPG2CUT2.REG

Change the path to match where you have installed Mpg2Cut2.EXE
Note that back slashes must be DOUBLED within the quoted string.
REPEAT FOR ALL OCCURENCES.

Save the changes and open in Regedit.
